# Self-Solving-Rubix-Cube

As my semester project in my Introduction to Computer Science course, I wrote complete simulation of a Rubikâ€™s cube in Python,       including 3D rendering of the cube. Using problem solving heuristics that I personally developed, the code animates a rapid solution of the cube from any starting configuration.
